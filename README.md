Objective of the app.

Manifesto Manager is a tool that will help you create schedules for your work group in a quick and easy way. Although it was designed mainly for restaurants, it can really be used for any work group that requires making a schedule with flexible editing options.

Logo description and meaning

The Manifesto Manager logo is an M for the words "Manifesto" and "Manager". Likewise, the M resembles the silhouette of a house, and represents the spirit of camaraderie that is experienced in work groups.

Device type, operating system version and supported orientations.

For MM, it was decided that the best mobile platform would be an iPhone and not an iPad, Macbook or iMac because the iPhone is practical and they are essential at work. It supports iOS versions 15.5 and later, allowing us to achieve a wide coverage of updated mobile devices. Because no feature requires horizontal orientation, the only orientation supported is vertical.
